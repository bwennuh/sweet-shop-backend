Flatiron Phase 1 Project - The Sweet Shop!

The files here contain the back-end components of Eni & Brenna's Sweet Shop app!

The intent is to garner interest on some different dessert options for the online Sweet Shop.

To do so, we need to organize the desserts in a JSON file. The JSON file will contain two categories - desserts (that are to already be included in the Sweet Shop store), and recommendations (for desserts that could also be added to the Sweet Shop store in the future!).
